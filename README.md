XIVProgression
=========================
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/Colbydude/XIVProgression/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Colbydude/XIVProgression/actions)

This tool is used for quickly checking a character's main scenario quest and duty progression in FFXIV. This saves the effort of having to actually go to the Lodestone and look things up. Information is collected using the [XIVAPI](https://xivapi.com) and checks for certain achievements. However, keep in mind that this tool will not work if the specified character does not have achievements viewable to the public.

**Powered By:** [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
